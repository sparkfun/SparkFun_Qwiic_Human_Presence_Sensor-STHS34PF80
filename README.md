The STHS34PF80 sensor, from [ST Microelectronics](https://www.st.com/
), is designed to measure the precise [black-body radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation) *(as described by [Plank's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law))* of an object; as well as monitor ambient temperature conditions within its 80&deg; field of view. The sensor is composed of a matrix of floating vacuum thermal transistors MOS split into two parts, one exposed to IR radiation and the other one shielded. The differential reading between the segments, allows the sensor to remove self-heating effects. The STHS34PF80 also incorporates algorithms to detect and discriminate between stationary and moving objects. These features enable the sensor to work as a human presence and motion sensor in different applications such as alarm systems, anti-intruder systems, smart lighting, and room occupancy.

The sensor can operate in multiple lighting conditions and is unaffected by visible light or other bands thanks to the 5 to 20&micro;m optical band-pass filter. The STHS34PF80 has an output data rates between 0.25 to 30 Hz and an available single-shot, which are accessed through its IÂ²C/SPI interface.

*These products are available in both the standard 1"x1" and mini Qwiic breakout boards. The mini is panel mount compatible for use in enclosures.*
