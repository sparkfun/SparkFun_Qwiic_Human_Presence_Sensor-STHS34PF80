## Qwiic Cable
The simplest method to connect a microcontroller to a Qwiic Human Presence/Motion Sensor board is through the Qwiic connector.

!!! info
	The [Qwiic connection system](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) is a standardized solderless, polarized connector interface that allows users to seamlessly daisy chain I<sup>2</sup>C boards together.

??? tip "Remove Tape"
	Users with the mini version of the Qwiic Human Presence/Motion Sensor board should remove the tape covering the Qwiic connector.

	!!! note
		The tweezers are not necessary, they were only used for illustration purposes. *(Fingers would have obscured the camera shot.)*

	!!! info
		The tape is used by the [pick-and-place machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick-and-place_machine) to place the connector on the board during assembly.


## Breakout Pins
The [PTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology "Plated Through Holes") pins on the Qwiic Human Presence/Motion Sensor board are broken out into 0.1"-spaced pins on the outer edge of the board.

### Hookup Wires
For a more permanent connection, users can solder wires directly to the board.

### Headers
When [selecting headers](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/381), be sure you are aware of the functionality or physical arrangement required.
